ZDC ARM ABI
===========

This document specifies the Application Binary Interface used by ARM binaries
as generated by ZDC.

ZDC's ARM ABI is based on following standards:

 (1) "Procedure Call Standard for the ARM Architecture"
 (2) "ARM GNU/Linux Application Binary Interface Supplement"
 (3) "D Application Binary Interface"
 
 Function Calling Conventions
 ----------------------------
 
 The calling convention used is as specified in (1) and (2). Function with
 C (extern (C)) and D linkage are using the same calling convention.
 
 Dynamic arrays are treated as 64-bit aggregate type when passed as function
 call arguments. The array length is stored as the first 32-bit word and the
 pointer the array data as the second 32-bit word.
 
 For example, when calling function func():
 
  void func(int[] a) { ... }
  
The length of the array will be stored in r0, and array pointer in r1
registers.

Name Mangling
-------------

The identifier name mangling used by ZDC is as specified in (3).
