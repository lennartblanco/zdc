XDC - the D compiler
--------------------

xdc is the compiler supporting small, but growing, subset of D 2.0 programming
language. It support compiling code for x86 and ARM targets.

Building
--------

Building the xdc requires following tools:

  flex
  gcc
  filepp
  dmd (Digital Mars D compiler, http://www.digitalmars.com/d/2.0/dmd-linux.html)
  GNU Make

The glib2 library and it's header files must be also installed.

To build compiler run 'make' from the same directory as this file. This will
generate the xdc binary. The default build time configuration is stored in
'config.default' file. To override default configuration add new setting to
'config' file.

Runtime
-------

The binaries generated by xdc will link to following libraries:

  libc - the standart C library
  libgc - the Hans-Boehm garbage collection library

Tests
-----

To run function test suits run 'make function_tests' and 'make errors_tests'.
