ZDC - the D compiler
--------------------

zdc is the compiler supporting small, but growing, subset of D 2.0 programming
language. It support compiling code for x86 and ARM targets.

Building
--------

Building the zdc requires following tools:

  flex
  gcc
  dmd (Digital Mars D compiler, http://www.digitalmars.com/d/2.0/dmd-linux.html)
  GNU Make

The glib2 library and it's header files must be also installed.

To build compiler run 'make' from the same directory as this file.

Successfull build will generate the zdc binary. When zdc binary is run directly,
it will compile the code for x86 target. To build for other targets, use the
generated symlinks. A symlink for each target listed in 'config' file will be
generated. The zdc binary uses the invocation name to determine for which
target to compile code.

Runtime
-------

The binaries generated by zdc will link to following libraries:

  libc - the standart C library
  libgc - the Hans-Boehm garbage collection library

Tests
-----

To run function test suits run 'make function_tests' and 'make errors_tests'.
